# UniT: One Document, Many Revisions, Too Many Edit Intention Taxonomies

## Overview
Writing is inherently iterative, each revision enhancing information representation. Examination of the intentions behind edits provides valuable insights. Current research on edit intentions lacks a comprehensive edit intention taxonomy (EIT) that spans multiple application domains. We develop a comprehensive EIT, **UniT**, that spans multiple application domains and encompasses all observed edit intentions, reducing the burden to create a new EIT for each application.

### Contributions

The contributions of this paper are as follows:
- We study 24 EITs and analyze their properties, such as structure, definitions, and revision examples. We also collect external resources, i.e., codes and datasets, and report on their reproducibility.
- We study the lineage relationship between EITs.
- We build an integrated EIT that spans multiple application domains and includes a large set of edit intentions.
- We compare our UNIT with existing EITs showing that that it achieves higher IAA scores and it is applicable to a larger set of application domains.

### Workflow

### Challenges
1. literature coverage to find all proposed EITs. The details can be found in [LiteratureReview.xlsx](./LiteratureReview.xlsx).

2. Integration procedure
    - Analyze and find lineage relationships between EITs, see [Lineage Relationship](#lineage-relationship)
    - Grouping
        - Reuse-based Grouping
        - Merge-based Grouping
        - Category Refinement Grouping
3. Edit intention matching
